            <p id="university-description">I came to Scotland in 2002 to study at Glasgow University. I had a very strong interest
            in Maths and Physics, but ultimately I decided to study Aerospace Engineering, because I thought it was pretty cool. 
            So I did my Bachelor's in Aeronautical Engineering, followed by a Masters in Mechanical Engineering, and graduated in 2007.
